# Implementation-of-Conformal-Predictors

This repository contains implementation of Conformal Predictors which is a relatively new Machine Learning Algorithm. There are 3 implementation of algorithm in jupyter notebooks also containing report , and Instruction files for these 3 implementations.

1) Simple Conformal Predictors with Nearest Neighbour Implementation.
2) Inductive Conformal Predictors Implementation and Lasso.
3) Cross-Conformal Predictors with SVM Implementation.
